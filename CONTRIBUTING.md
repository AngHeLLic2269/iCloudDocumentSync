1. Sign up for a GitHub Account  
2. Star this repository (so you can follow changes and find it easily)  
3. Fork this repository and clone your fork onto your computer  
4. Make changes to the forked repo

#### Code Guidelines
Before submitting any code changes, read over the code / syntax guidelines to make sure everything you write matches the appropriate coding style. The [Objective-C Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions) are available on GitHub.

#### Building the Framework
Building the Framework for iCloud is easy, just follow these simple steps:

1. Make any changes to the project and build it with the *iCloud* target selected.
2. When you've finished making changes and testing, select the *Framework* target from the scheme selector in the upper-left corner of Xcode. Click on Build / Run. Xcode will generate the framework and write it to the project folder.

#### Documentation Guidelines
Before submitting any changes, make sure that you've documented those changes. If necessary, make the appropriate updates in the Readme.md file. You should also write appropriate documentation in the code (using comments). You can use documentation comments to create and modify documentation. Always write the documentation comments above the related function, variable, struct, etc. Write regular comments with your code too.

## What to Contribute
Contribute anything, we're open to ideas! Although if you're looking for a little more structure, you can go through the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync/issues?status=open) or look at the known issues in the [Releases documentation](https://github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync/releases). And if you're feeling adventurous, we're still working on adding OS X Compatibility (wink wink, nudge nudge).
